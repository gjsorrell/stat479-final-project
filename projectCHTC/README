Run "condor_submit_dag submit.dag" to cause all the code specified in
the following Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), below, to run:

 (pre 1)  pre.sh
              |
              V
 (job 1)  job.sub
            / | \
   13 parallel runs of job.sh (job.R)
            \ | /
              V
 (post 1) merge.sh
 	        
          
Once we get merge.tsv, we make some further transformations and logistic regression analysis in report.Rmd.
